## 📘 Foundation Level

### 🔹 What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source platform to **automate deploying, scaling, and managing** containerized applications.

### 🔹 Basics of Kubernetes
Learn key components: **Pods, Nodes, Clusters, and Services**. This is your K8s vocabulary.

### 🔹 Container Orchestration
Why orchestrate? To **ensure app availability, fault tolerance**, and **load balancing** in production.

### 🔹 Kubernetes vs Docker / Docker Swarm
Kubernetes offers **advanced orchestration and scaling** that Docker Swarm lacks.

### 🔹 Why Kubernetes for Docker?
Docker packages apps, but Kubernetes **runs them efficiently across multiple machines**.

### 🔹 Kubernetes Architecture Deep Dive
Understand **Master Node**, **Worker Node**, and key services like **etcd, API Server, Kubelet**, and **Scheduler**.

## ⚙️ Core Concepts

### 🏗️ Cluster Setup & App Deployment
- **Installation & Configuration** – Local (minikube) or cloud (EKS)
- **EKS Cluster Creation** – Create managed clusters on AWS
- **Deploy & Scale Apps** – Use `kubectl` to manage deployments

### 🧱 Key Building Blocks
- **Pods** – Smallest deployable unit in K8s
- **ReplicaSets** – Ensure a desired number of pods run
- **Deployments** – Declarative updates to Pods/ReplicaSets
- **Services** – Expose your app inside/outside the cluster
- **Volumes & Namespaces** – Store data & isolate environments

### 🔀 Resource Management
- **Resource Requirements** – Allocate CPU & Memory
- **Multi-Container Pods** – Run sidecar patterns (e.g., logging)
- **Deployment Strategies** – Rolling updates, blue-green deployments

---

## 🛡️ Security & Configuration

### 🔒 Core Security
- **Security Contexts** – Set user permissions for containers
- **Secrets vs ConfigMaps** – Store sensitive vs config data securely
- **RBAC** – Control access using roles & bindings
- **Network Policies** – Restrict pod communication

---

## 📂 Configuration Mastery

### 🧾 YAML Files & Scheduling
- **Manifest Deep Dive** – Write and understand deployment YAMLs
- **Scheduling Applications** – Influence pod placement
- **Advanced Scheduling** – Node affinity, taints, tolerations

---

## 🌐 Networking

### 🌍 Ingress & Traffic Management
- **Ingress Resources** – Route traffic via HTTP
- **Ingress Controllers** – NGINX or other controllers to manage traffic

### 📦 Storage & Stateful Apps
- **Volumes (PV & PVC)** – Persistent storage for apps
- **DaemonSets & StatefulSets** – Run pods on every node or maintain app identity

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Real Projects

### 🔧 Practical Tips
- **K8s Troubleshooting** – Debug common pod & node issues
- **Cluster Upgrades (EKS)** – Keep your cloud cluster up-to-date

### 🚀 Mini Projects
- **K8s Microservices Project** – Deploy a real-world multi-service app
- **Optional CI/CD Integration** – Combine GitHub Actions or Jenkins
